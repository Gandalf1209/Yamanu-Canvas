Yamanu-Canvas
=============

JavaScript Library that helps with drawing to, and dealing with the HTML5 canvas element

Yamanu Game Engine is another one of my projects that works with Java. After getting into web development a bit, I have decided to make a library for JavaScript. I have made canvas drawing a bit simpler, and added a key library. The key library needs a few things more to work, but the Core.JS should be in working condition!
